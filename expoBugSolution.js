While a definitive solution isn't yet available, several investigative approaches can be taken:

1. **Increase memory allocation:**  The server might be crashing due to memory limitations. Try increasing the available memory to the Expo development server. 
2. **Check for memory leaks:** Profile the application to identify potential memory leaks in your code that might be contributing to the crashes. 
3. **Examine asynchronous operations:** Analyze asynchronous operations within your application for potential race conditions or unhandled exceptions.  Ensure promises are properly handled.
4. **Simplify project:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem. Remove unnecessary packages and code to pinpoint if a specific component is causing the issue.
5. **Update Expo CLI and dependencies:** Ensure all Expo packages and dependencies are up-to-date. 
6. **Check logs:** Carefully review device and simulator logs for subtle clues, though this might be challenging with intermittent crashes. 
7. **Community Support:** Consult the Expo forums or GitHub issues to see if similar problems have been reported.
