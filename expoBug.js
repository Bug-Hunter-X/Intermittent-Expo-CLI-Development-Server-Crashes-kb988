While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any specific error messages in the terminal.  The app itself would also stop working, requiring a restart of both the server and the simulator/device. This occurred intermittently, making debugging challenging.  No specific code changes seemed to trigger this behavior, and it happened across different projects.
